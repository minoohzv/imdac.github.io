Bought me a cat and the cat pleased me
I fed my cat under yonder tree
Cat goes fiddle-i-fee

Bought me a hen and the hen pleased me
I fed my hen under yonder tree
Hen goes chimmy-chuck, chimmy-chuck
Cat goes fiddle-i-fee

Bought me a duck and the duck pleased me
I fed my duck under yonder tree
Duck goes quack, quack
Hen goes chimmy-chuck, chimmy-chuck
Cat goes fiddle-i-fee
